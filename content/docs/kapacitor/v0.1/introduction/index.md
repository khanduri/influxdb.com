Kapacitor is a time series data processing engine.
Kapacitor is the final piece of the TICK stack.

* T - Telegraf -- Data collection
* I - InfluxDB -- Data storage
* C - Chronograf -- Data visualization
* K - Kapacitor -- Data processing

Kapacitor provides a way for you to define a pipeline for processing time series data.
You can use Kapacitor to perform monitoring and alerting or to do large ETL jobs.
Kapacitor can process both streaming data and batch data.
You can stream data to Kapacitor directly from InfluxDB or you can instruct Kapacitor to query data from InfluxDB on a schedule.



See the [getting started guides](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/introduction/getting_started.html) for walk through on getting up and running with Kapacitor.
