A BatchNode defines a source and a schedule for
processing batch data. The data is queried from
an InfluxDB database and then passed into the data pipeline.

Example:


```javascript
 batch
     .query('''
         SELECT mean("value")
         FROM "telegraf"."default".cpu_usage_idle
         WHERE "host" = 'serverA'
     ''')
     .period(10s)
     .groupBy(time(2s), "cpu")
     ...
```

In the above example InfluxDB is queried every 10 seconds and the results
are then processed by the rest of the pipeline.


Properties
----------

Property methods modify state on the calling node. They do not add another node to the pipeline and always return a reference to the calling node.

### GroupBy

Group the data by a set of dimensions.
At least one dimension should be a `time()`
dimension, the rest are tag names.


```javascript
node.groupBy(d ...interface{})
```


### Period

The period at which Kapacitor should query InfluxDB.


```javascript
node.period(value time.Duration)
```


### Query

The query to execute. Must not contain a time condition
in the `WHERE` clause or contain a `GROUP BY` clause.
The time conditions are added dynamically according to the period.
The `GROUP BY` clause is added dynamically according to the dimensions
passed to the `groupBy` method.


```javascript
node.query(value string)
```


Chaining Methods
----------------

Chaining methods create a new node in the pipeline as a child of the calling node. They do not modify the calling node.

### Alert

Create an alert node, which can trigger alerts.


```javascript
node.alert()
```

Returns: [AlertNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/alert_node.html)


### Apply

Create an apply node that will apply the given transformation function to each data point.
See the built-in function `expr` in order to write in-line custom transformation functions.


```javascript
node.apply(transform interface{})
```

Returns: [ApplyNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/apply_node.html)


### HttpOut

Create an http output node that caches the most recent data it has received.
The cached data is available at the given endpoint.
The endpoint is the relative path from the API endpoint of the running task.
For example if the task endpoint is at &#34;/api/v1/task/&lt;task_name&gt;&#34; and endpoint is
&#34;top10&#34;, then the data can be requested from &#34;/api/v1/task/&lt;task_name&gt;/top10&#34;.


```javascript
node.httpOut(endpoint string)
```

Returns: [HTTPOutNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/http_out_node.html)


### InfluxDBOut

Create an influxdb output node that will store the incoming data into InfluxDB.


```javascript
node.influxDBOut()
```

Returns: [InfluxDBOutNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/influx_d_b_out_node.html)


### Join

Join this node with another node. The data is joined on time.


```javascript
node.join(other Node)
```

Returns: [JoinNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/join_node.html)


### Map

Perform just the map step of a map-reduce operation.
A map step must always be followed by a reduce step.
See Apply for performing simple transformations.
See MapReduce for performing map-reduce in one command.

NOTE: Map can only be applied to batch edges.


```javascript
node.map(f interface{})
```

Returns: [MapNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/map_node.html)


### MapReduce

Perform a map-reduce operation on the data.
The built-in functions under `influxql` provide the
selection,aggregation, and transformation functions
from the InfluxQL language.

NOTE: MapReduce can only be applied to batch edges.


```javascript
node.mapReduce(mr MapReduceInfo)
```

Returns: [ReduceNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/reduce_node.html)


### Reduce

Perform just the reduce step of a map-reduce operation.

NOTE: Reduce can only be applied to map edges.


```javascript
node.reduce(f interface{})
```

Returns: [ReduceNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/reduce_node.html)


### Union

Perform the union of this node and all other given nodes.


```javascript
node.union(node ...Node)
```

Returns: [UnionNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/union_node.html)


### Where

Create a new node that filters the data stream by a given expression.


```javascript
node.where(expression string)
```

Returns: [WhereNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/where_node.html)


### Window

Create a new node that windows the stream by time.

NOTE: Window can only be applied to stream edges.


```javascript
node.window()
```

Returns: [WindowNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/window_node.html)
