A StreamNode represents the source of data being
streamed to Kapacitor via any of its inputs.
The stream node allows you to select which portion of the stream
you want to process.

If you want to process multiple independent streams see the `fork` chaining method.

Example:


```javascript
    stream
           .from('''"mydb"."myrp"."mymeasurement"''')
           .where("host =~ /logger\d+/")
        .window()
        ...
```

The above example selects only data points from the database `mydb`
and retention policy `myrp` and measurement `mymeasurement` where
the tag `host` matches the regex `logger\d+`


Properties
----------

Property methods modify state on the calling node. They do not add another node to the pipeline and always return a reference to the calling node.

### From

Which database, retention policy and measurement to select.
This is equivalent to the FROM statement in an InfluxQL
query. As such shortened selectors can be supplied
(i.e. &#34;mymeasurement&#34; is valid and selects all data points
from the measurement &#34;mymeasurement&#34; independent
of database or retention policy).

If empty then all data points are considered to match.


```javascript
node.from(value string)
```


### Where

Filter the current stream using the given expression.
This expression is a Kapacitor expression. Kapacitor
expressions are a superset of InfluxQL WHERE expressions.
See the `Expression` docs for more information.

If empty then all data points are considered to match.


```javascript
node.where(expression string)
```


Chaining Methods
----------------

Chaining methods create a new node in the pipeline as a child of the calling node. They do not modify the calling node.

### Alert

Create an alert node, which can trigger alerts.


```javascript
node.alert()
```

Returns: [AlertNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/alert_node.html)


### Apply

Create an apply node that will apply the given transformation function to each data point.
See the built-in function `expr` in order to write in-line custom transformation functions.


```javascript
node.apply(transform interface{})
```

Returns: [ApplyNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/apply_node.html)


### Fork

Fork the current stream. This is useful if you want to
select multiple different data streams.

Example:


```javascript
    var errors = stream.fork().from("errors")
    var requests = stream.fork().from("requests")
```

Example:


```javascript
    // This will not work since you are just changing
    // the 'from' condition on the same stream node.
    var errors = stream.from("errors")
    var requests = stream.from("requests")
    // 'errors' is now the same as 'requests'.
```



```javascript
node.fork()
```

Returns: [StreamNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/stream_node.html)


### GroupBy

Group the data by a set of tags.


```javascript
node.groupBy(tag ...string)
```

Returns: [GroupByNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/group_by_node.html)


### HttpOut

Create an http output node that caches the most recent data it has received.
The cached data is available at the given endpoint.
The endpoint is the relative path from the API endpoint of the running task.
For example if the task endpoint is at &#34;/api/v1/task/&lt;task_name&gt;&#34; and endpoint is
&#34;top10&#34;, then the data can be requested from &#34;/api/v1/task/&lt;task_name&gt;/top10&#34;.


```javascript
node.httpOut(endpoint string)
```

Returns: [HTTPOutNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/http_out_node.html)


### InfluxDBOut

Create an influxdb output node that will store the incoming data into InfluxDB.


```javascript
node.influxDBOut()
```

Returns: [InfluxDBOutNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/influx_d_b_out_node.html)


### Join

Join this node with another node. The data is joined on time.


```javascript
node.join(other Node)
```

Returns: [JoinNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/join_node.html)


### Map

Perform just the map step of a map-reduce operation.
A map step must always be followed by a reduce step.
See Apply for performing simple transformations.
See MapReduce for performing map-reduce in one command.

NOTE: Map can only be applied to batch edges.


```javascript
node.map(f interface{})
```

Returns: [MapNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/map_node.html)


### MapReduce

Perform a map-reduce operation on the data.
The built-in functions under `influxql` provide the
selection,aggregation, and transformation functions
from the InfluxQL language.

NOTE: MapReduce can only be applied to batch edges.


```javascript
node.mapReduce(mr MapReduceInfo)
```

Returns: [ReduceNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/reduce_node.html)


### Reduce

Perform just the reduce step of a map-reduce operation.

NOTE: Reduce can only be applied to map edges.


```javascript
node.reduce(f interface{})
```

Returns: [ReduceNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/reduce_node.html)


### Union

Perform the union of this node and all other given nodes.


```javascript
node.union(node ...Node)
```

Returns: [UnionNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/union_node.html)


### Window

Create a new node that windows the stream by time.

NOTE: Window can only be applied to stream edges.


```javascript
node.window()
```

Returns: [WindowNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/window_node.html)
